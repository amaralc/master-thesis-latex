Hence, topology optimization technique is rapidly becoming a promising tool to design additive manufactured structures to reduce weight and achieve optimal performance simultaneously.

It not only plays a role as a rapid prototyping technology for saving capital and time during the product development period but also brings profound influences on product design, direct part fabrication, assembly, and repair in the aerospace industry. Because of recent developments, AM has rapidly become a strategic technology that will generate revenues throughout the aerospace supply chain. In this chapter, we analyze the characteristics of aerospace components favoring AM, discuss different aerospace applications benefit from different AM processes, and describe the repair applications for aerospace components. Examples of aerospace applications both from commercial and academia areas are also analyzed. Finally, this chapter discusses the challenges of applying AM to the aerospace industry and potential future aerospace applications.}

  abstract       = {In the circular economy, products, components, and materials are aimed to be kept at the utility and value all the lifetime. For this purpose, repair and remanufacturing are highly considered as proper techniques to return the value of the product during its life. Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is a very flexible type of additive manufacturing (AM), and among the AM techniques, it is most suitable for repairing and remanufacturing automotive and aerospace components. Its application allows damaged component to be repaired, and material lost in service to be replaced to restore the part to its original shape. In the past, tungsten inert gas welding was used as the main repair method. However, its heat affected zone is larger, and the quality is inferior. In comparison with the conventional welding processes, repair via DED has more advantages, including lower heat input, warpage and distortion, higher cooling rate, lower dilution rate, excellent metallurgical bonding between the deposited layers, high precision, and suitability for full automation. Hence, the proposed repairing method based on DED appears to be a capable method of repairing. Therefore, the focus of this study was to present an overview of the DED process and its role in the repairing of metallic components. The outcomes of this study confirm the significant capability of DED process as a repair and remanufacturing technology.},

The additive manufacturing techniques utilized to generate samples covered in this review include powder bed fusion (e.g., EBM, SLM, DMLS) and directed energy deposition (e.g., LENS, EBF3). Although only a limited number of metallic alloy systems are currently available for additive manufacturing (e.g., Ti-6Al-4V, TiAl, stainless steel, Inconel 625/718, and Al-Si-10Mg), the bulk of the published mechanical properties information has been generated on Ti-6Al-4V. However, summary tables for published mechanical properties and/or key figures are included for each of the alloys listed above, grouped by the additive technique used to generate the data. Published values for mechanical properties obtained from hardness, tension/compression, fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth, and high cycle fatigue are included for as-built, heat-treated, and/or HIP conditions, when available. The effects of test orientation/build direction on properties, when available, are also provided, along with discussion of the potential source(s) (e.g., texture, microstructure changes, defects) of anisotropy in properties.
